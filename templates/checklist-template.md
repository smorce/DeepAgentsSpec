# [DOMAIN] Requirements Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]

**Purpose**: Validate the quality of requirements for the [DOMAIN] aspect of this feature (not to test implementation behavior).
**Created**: [DATE]
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md or relevant documentation]
**Feature ID**: [FEATURE-ID]
**Checklist Path**: `plans/.../features/[FEATURE-ID]/checklists/[domain-slug].md`

**Note**: 
- This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.
- It is a **domain-specific, auxiliary checklist** (e.g., `ux.md`, `api.md`, `security.md`, `performance.md`).
- The **official specification quality gate** is managed separately via `checklists/requirements.md` and `scripts/validate_spec.sh`.
- Save the rendered file under the target feature directory (`FEATURE_DIR/checklists/<domain>.md`). You may seed baseline content via `scripts/bash/add-domain-checklist.sh` or `scripts/powershell/add-domain-checklist.ps1` before customizing.
- Items in this file must test the **requirements text itself** (completeness/clarity/consistency/coverage), **not** implementation behavior.

<!-- 
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The checklist items below are SAMPLE ITEMS for illustration only.

  The /speckit.checklist command MUST replace these with actual items based on:
  - User's specific checklist request (e.g., UX/API/Security/Performance focus)
  - Feature requirements from spec.md
  - (Optionally) Technical context from plan.md
  - (Optionally) Task context from tasks.md

  HOWEVER: Even when using plan.md or tasks.md as context,
  ALL generated checklist items MUST focus on the QUALITY of requirements
  (completeness / clarity / consistency / coverage / measurability),
  and MUST NOT become implementation test cases.
  
  DO NOT keep these sample items in the generated checklist file.

## [Category 1: Requirement Completeness]

- [ ] CHK001 Are all [DOMAIN]-related requirements for this feature explicitly documented? [Completeness]
- [ ] CHK002 Are error/exception scenarios for [DOMAIN] requirements identified and written down? [Completeness, Gap]
- [ ] CHK003 Are dependencies and assumptions affecting [DOMAIN] clearly listed in the spec? [Completeness, Dependencies]

## [Category 2: Requirement Clarity & Consistency]

- [ ] CHK004 Is any vague term (e.g., "fast", "secure", "intuitive") in [DOMAIN] requirements quantified or clarified with specific criteria? [Clarity]
- [ ] CHK005 Are [DOMAIN]-related requirements consistent across all referenced sections (no conflicting statements)? [Consistency]
- [ ] CHK006 Can the [DOMAIN] requirements be objectively verified (e.g., by measurable acceptance criteria)? [Measurability]

## Notes

- Check items off as completed: `- [x]`
- Add comments or findings inline (e.g., where the spec needs updates)
- Link to relevant resources or documentation (e.g., `[Spec §FR-3]`, `[Spec §NFR-2]`)
- CHK IDs should be numbered sequentially within this file for easy reference
