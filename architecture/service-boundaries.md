# Service Boundaries

This document explains how responsibilities are split between the microservices.
It clarifies the API gateway's role as the public edge, the user service's ownership
of onboarding and identity data, the billing service's charge and invoice logic, and
the avatar UI's responsibility for the user-facing agent interface plus its local AG-UI server.
Boundaries will be updated whenever the system evolves.
